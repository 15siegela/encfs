# EncFS - an Encrypted Filesystem

## Status

This is the development branch of EncFS.  

WARNING - backward compatibility has been dropped many times during the
development of 2.x, and almost certainly will be again.

This branch should be able to read filesystems constructed from 1.x (modulo
some bugs), but it cannot produce 1.x filesystems.
