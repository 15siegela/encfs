{"name":"Encfs","tagline":"EncFS: an Encrypted Filesystem for FUSE.","body":"# EncFS - an Encrypted Filesystem\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nEncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs in userspace, \r\nusing the FUSE library for the filesystem interface. EncFS is open source\r\nsoftware, licensed under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nEncFS was written by necessity over a decade ago by me, @vgough.  At the time,\r\nolder NFS-loopback based encrypted filesystems such as CFS had not kept pace with Linux\r\ndevelopment.  When FUSE became available, I wrote a CFS replacement for my own\r\nuse and released the first version to Open Source in 2003.\r\n\r\nAs with most encrypted filesystems, Encfs was meant to provide security against\r\noff-line attacks; ie your notebook or backups are left in a taxi by mistake, stolen, etc.\r\nIn order to avoid having a dedicated partition size, EncFS encrypts individual files, \r\nby translating all requests for the virtual EncFS filesystem into the equivalent \r\nencrypted operations on the raw filesystem. \r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nOver the last decade, a number of good alternatives have grown up.  Computing\r\npower has increased to the point where it is reasonable to encrypt the entire\r\nfilesystem of personal computers.  On Linux, ecryptfs\r\nprovides a nice dynamically mountable encrypted home directory, and is well\r\nintegrated in distributions I use, such as Ubuntu.  Every compute I use, including\r\nmy mobile phones, use full-disk encryption.  However there always seem to be new\r\nuse cases for userspace file-by-file encryption, so EncFS remains useful.\r\n\r\nEncFS has been dormant for a while.  I've started cleaning up in order to try\r\nand provide a better base for a version 2, but whether EncFS flowers again\r\ndepends upon community interest.  In order to make it easier for anyone to\r\ncontribute, I'm looking at Github as the next home for EncFS.  So if you're\r\ninterested in EncFS, please dive in!\r\n\r\n## GitHub page\r\n\r\nGitHub hosting for EncFS is in progress.  Until the transition is complete, \r\nsee also the original, and more complete, introduction page at http://www.arg0.net/encfs\r\n","google":"UA-108985-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
