<h2>
<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>EncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space.  It runs with regular user
permissions using the <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> library to act as a filesystem.
EncFS is open source software, licensed under the LGPL.</p>

<p>EncFS was written due to necessity over a decade ago.  At the time,
older NFS-loopback based encrypted filesystems such as CFS had not kept pace with Linux
development.  When FUSE became available, I wrote a CFS replacement for my own
use and released the first version to Open Source in 2003.</p>

<p>As with most encrypted filesystems, EncFS was meant to provide security against
off-line attacks; ie your notebook or backups are left in a taxi by mistake, stolen, etc.
In order to avoid having a dedicated partition size, EncFS encrypts individual files, 
by translating all requests for the virtual EncFS filesystem into the equivalent 
encrypted operations on the raw filesystem. </p>

<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h2>

<p>Over the last decade, a number of good alternatives have grown up.  Computing
power has increased to the point where it is reasonable to encrypt the entire
filesystem of personal computers.  On Linux, <a href="http://ecryptfs.org/">ecryptfs</a>
provides a nice dynamically mountable encrypted home directory, and is well
integrated in distributions I use, such as <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.
Every compute I use, including my mobile phones, use full-disk encryption.<br>
However there always seem to be new use cases for userspace file-by-file encryption, 
so EncFS remains useful.</p>

<p>EncFS has been dormant for a while.  I've started cleaning up in order to try
and provide a better base for a version 2, but whether EncFS flowers again
depends upon community interest.  In order to make it easier for anyone to
contribute, I'm looking at Github as the next home for EncFS.  So if you're
interested in EncFS, please dive in!</p>

<p>GitHub hosting for EncFS is in progress.  Until the transition is complete,
